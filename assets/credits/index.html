<h1>Credits</h1>
<p>This page is in case you used art that you need to give proper credits for the artist to, or anything of the sort.</p>
<p>You can also disable this page on the <code>project-settings.json</code> file.</p>
<p>You don't need to put me in the credits of your page, this code is <a href="https://opensource.org/license/MIT" target="_blank">MIT</a> licensed so all you gotta do is to keep the <code>LICENSE</code> file with my name in the source code. Of course I wouldn't complain if you included me in the credits too!</p>
