<h1>About Maps</h1>
<p>
    Each map is a JSON file and an image. Don't worry if you don't know what JSON is, you can just straight copy a map
    JSON from here, open it up with notepad and change the data fields to match what you're making. If you open any of
    these map files you will see a bunch of fields of data to be edited. This article will briefly explain them.
</p>
<table-of-contents></table-of-contents>
<h2 id="about-name">About name</h2>
<p>
    The name field is the map's title. <em>This is what will show up on the <a tomenu="maps-index">maps index</a>
        page.</em> The filename is also important and is similar to <a toarticle="about-articles">articles</a>. <em>The
        filename is what will be used to link to your map</em>, so if you have a map file called
    <em>island-of-moon-shards.json</em>, you will link to it with an anchor with a
    <em>tomap="island-of-moon-shards"</em> attribute to it. More about links on the <a
        toarticle="about-articles">articles</a> page.
</p>
<h2 id="about-image">About image</h2>
<p>
    The image field is the image file for this map. <em>All images must be inside the <em>assets/images</em>
        folder.</em>
</p>
<h2 id="about-links">About links</h2>
<p>
    This is a list of every link on your map. If you see any map on this, you will see that it's the image with a bunch
    of links on top. The idea is that these links will act like the name of the places they're on, and they're linking
    to an article explaining that place. Every link has a <em>name</em>, a <em>size</em>, a <em>pos</em> and they can
    have <em>toarticle</em> and/or <em>tomap</em> fields.
</p>
<p>
    Again, read about links on the <a toarticle="about-articles">articles</a> page, but you can also learn everything
    about links by seeing the source file of any article, including this one on
    <code>assets/articles/about-maps.html</code>.
</p>
<h3 id="link-names">Link names</h3>
<p>
    This name is what will be inside the <code>a</code> tag, so it's what's going to show up on the map's page and be
    read by humans.
</p>
<h3 id="link-sizes">Link sizes</h3>
<p>
    There are three sizes: <em>large</em>, <em>medium</em> and <em>small</em>. They're just for style. You can see how
    all of them look like by accessing a map and checking its source file.
</p>
<h3 id="link-pos">Link pos</h3>
<p>
    As you might have guessed, it stands for position. It is the position of the link in relation to the image in
    percentages of its size. It starts from the top left and goes to the bottom right, so a position of <code>"x":
        "50%", "y": "50%"</code> means the exact center of the map, while something like <code>"x": "20%", "y":
        "80%"</code> is close to the bottom left.
</p>
<p>
    All positions must have both the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> fields, and all links must have a position.
</p>
<h3 id="link-rotation">Link rotation</h3>
<p>
    This is an optional field, you can just not include it if you don't want to. If you use it, put a number on it and
    it
    will rotate your link by that number in degrees, so 90 will make it vertical, 45 is perfectly diagonal and so on.
    You can put negative numbers in there too, so numbers from 90 to -90 should cover all angles.
</p>
<h3 id="link-radius">Link radius</h3>
<p>
    This is an optional field, you can just not include it if you don't want to. If you use it, put a number on it and
    it will curve the link text as if it was written on the diameter of a circle with radius equal to the number you put
    in, in pixels. That means the bigger the number, the less curved the text will be. A negative radius curves the text
    the other way.
</p>
<h3 id="link-tomaps-and-toarticles">Link tomaps and toarticles</h3>
<p>
    These are the filenames of the article/map you're trying to link to. If you've seen the source file of any article
    and seen how links that link to an article or map inside the page look like, it's the same thing.
</p>
<p>
    A link with <code>"toarticle": "about-maps"</code> should link to this article right here, while a link with
    <code>"tomap": "map2"</code> should link to <a tomap="map2">Example Map Two</a>. You don't need to have one or the
    other, you can have neither or even both at the same time, but having links without either should look weird as your
    players might think they are broken, so use them with care.
</p>
<h2 id="about-json">About JSON</h2>
<p>
    Lastly, I wanted to talk about JSON. If you have never seen this file type, don't worry. I'm just writing this
    section here because they are very easy to mess up and might be a source of frustration with your maps not loading.
    <em>Every field name needs to be inside quotation marks</em>, and if you forget to close a quotation mark, your map
    won't load. Same thing for the value of each field, at least for these map JSONs, these values must be inside
    quotation marks.
</p>
<p>
    Also, <em>after every pair of field/value, there must be a comma except after the last one</em>. You can see that
    after the name and the image, there is a comma. Forgetting that comma will cause your map to not load. You can also
    see a comma after every curly braces at the end of every link entry as well, and as you might have guessed it,
    forgetting these will cause your map to break.
</p>
<p>
    Except for the last entries. You can see that after the last link, there is no comma at its closing curly braces.
    <em>Adding a comma here will cause your map to not load.</em> Yes, I know it's annoying but it's the easiest way to
    interface with browsers and the internet right now. Maybe in the future if it becomes enough of a pain point I might
    add support for a better data storage means, but right now I think it's good enough.
</p>
<p>
    For all these reasons, I recommend you only make maps by copying working maps and editing out it's values. You can
    add more links by copying an entire block and adding them to the list, just be careful when adding to the bottom of
    the list. You can just add them to the top of the list instead, the order of the links in this link won't matter
    since you manually set their positions anyway. Just come back to this article if any map breaks and carefully comb
    your file.
