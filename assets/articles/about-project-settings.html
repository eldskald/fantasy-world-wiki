<h1>About Project Settings</h1>
<p>
    This article is meant to explain the <code>project-settings.json</code> file. It's a JSON file with some settings
    about the project, mostly it contains all the text in the webpage that isn't in an article/map you wrote (like the
    links on the top bar) to allow you to edit them.
</p>

<h2 id="title-and-icon">Title and ion</h2>
<p>
    The <em>title</em> field is the title of the whole webpage, you know, the one that shows up on your browser's tab
    side by side with an icon. That icon by the way is the one at <code>assets/icons/favicon.svg</code>, set by the
    <em>icon</em> field, and it also shows up on the navbar with the index links. You put any icon on the
    <code>assets/icon</code> folder and write its name on this field and it should show up as your site's icon.
</p>
<h2 id="default-map">Default map</h2>
<p>
    The <em>defaultMap</em> entry is the initial map that loads in when you enter the page. Treat it like any other
    <code>a</code> tag with a <em>tomap</em> attribute, just put the name of the map (the filename without the
    <code>.json</code>) and it will become your main/default map to load into.
</p>
<h2 id="enable-credits-page">Enable credits page</h2>
<p>
    The <em>enableCreditsPage</em> field is the only one whose value isn't contained by quotation marks, be careful with
    it. It does exactly what it says. If you put <code>false</code> in it, it removes the credits link on the navbar and
    won't read from the <a tomenu="credits">credits</a> file at <code>assets/credits/index.html</code>. Do it if you
    don't need to put credits to anyone and you don't want to distract your readers with anything. Usually people put
    art in their pages that require credits, this is what this page is mainly for.
</p>
<h2 id="labels">Labels</h2>
<p>
    The <em>labels</em> field is a list of a bunch of labels on the rest of the site that you can't change from articles
    or maps. To give you full control of your own site, I needed to allow you to change those labels too, and this is
    what this entry is for. You don't need to change them, it won't really impact the usability of your page unless your
    page is written in a different language. Translations are probably the most common usecase for changing these. If
    you want to translate them, feel free to do so. Just change the values, don't touch the name of the fields
    themselves and don't forget the double quotes and commas on the right places.
</p>
<h2 id="about-json">About JSON</h2>
<p>
    Lastly, I wanted to talk about JSON. If you have never seen this file type, don't worry. I'm just writing this
    section here because they are very easy to mess up and might be a source of frustration with your settings not
    loading. <em>Every field name needs to be inside quotation marks</em>, and if you forget to close a quotation mark,
    your settings won't load. Same thing for the value of each field, except for the <em>enableCreditsPage</em> value.
</p>
<p>
    Also, <em>after every pair of field/value, there must be a comma except after the last one</em>. You can see that
    after the name and the image, there is a comma. Forgetting that comma will break your settings. There is an
    exception though, which is the last entry. <em>After the last entry, there must not be a comma</em> and putting one
    there will break your settings.
</p>
<p>
    The easiest way to keep everything working is just copy paste this file and only change the values inside the double
    quotes, don't touch anything else. If your settings break, come to this repository and compare your settings file to
    the one here. If you can't find what's wrong, try remaking it from scratch by copy pasting the one here. Change each
    value one by one, only moving to the next after you can see that the current setting files work in your page.
