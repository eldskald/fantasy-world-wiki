<h1>About Articles</h1>
<p>
    This article is here to explain some basic functionalities about articles.
</p>

<h2 id="article-file-names-and-titles">Article file names and titles</h2>
<p>
    When you upload your articles, to update your page with them we will scan them for their titles. <em>The title is
        assumed to be whatever is inside the <code>h1</code> header tag.</em> This title will be used on the <a
        tomenu="articles-index">articles index</a> page. You can access it to see all articles of your page listed, and
    every entry has the text inside its <code>h1</code> tag. <em>This means that having one <code>h1</code> header
        inside every article is obligatory.</em> It doesn't need to be the first tag, it can be anywhere on the article
    and you can even have more than one if you want to, but I think it would look ugly and confusing. You can see <a
        toarticle="images-example">this article</a> for an example of an article whose first tag isn't an
    <code>h1</code> tag.
</p>
<p>
    Lastly, the filename you choose is also important. <em>It will be the URL for your article and the name you'll to
        link to it.</em> You might have noticed how navigating through maps and articles changes the URL. Whatever is
    after the <em>article=</em> part on your URL is the article filename for the article you are currently reading,
    without the <em>.html</em> extension of course. It is also the name you will use on links, see next session.
</p>
<h2 id="about-links">About links</h2>
<p>
    You might have noticed that links use an <code>a</code> tag. It stands for anchor. If you want to link to an
    article, give it a <em>toarticle</em> attribute with the filename of the article you want to link to and it should
    work. Similarly for maps, a <em>tomap</em> attribute with the filename of the map you're trying to link to should
    work. You can link to both an article and a map too. Lastly, you can also put a <em>tofragment</em> attribute to put
    a fragment on the link, that is, put it with the <em>id</em> of an element on your document to have it scroll to it.
    Preferably, you use <em>tofragment</em> together with <em>toarticle</em>, where <em>tofragment</em> has the
    <em>id</em> of an element in the document of the linked article in <em>toarticle</em>. For more information about
    <em>id</em>'s, see the <a tofragment="about-the-table-of-contents">about the table of contents</a> section.
</p>
<p>
    If you haven't found links like this already, <a toarticle="about-articles">here</a> is a link to this same article
    so clicking it should do nothing, and <a tomap="map2">here</a> is a link to map two. You can put links to external
    websites as well, like <a href="https://github.com/eldskald/fantasy-world-wiki" target="_blank">this link to the
        project repository</a>. You can just copy this syntax and replace the URL on the <em>href</em> attribute for the
    URL you want to link to.
</p>
<h2 id="about-the-table-of-contents">About the table of contents</h2>
<p>
    You might have noticed every article has a table of contents at the beginning. You have to put it there, it's the
    <code>table-of-contents</code> tag that's on every article's source file. You can just copy that line and put it
    wherever you want the table of contents to be in.
</p>
<p>
    The way it works is that it will scan your entire article for <code>h2</code>, <code>h3</code> and <code>h4</code>
    tags and list them, the text inside the tags is what will be listed in the table of contents. If you click any link
    in it, it will scroll directly to this section in the article. Also, look at what happens to your URL. You will see
    a <em>#section-name</em> added to the end of it. This text is the <em>id</em> of the tag. You don't need an
    <em>id</em> on every header, but only those with one can be linked to and as the name suggests, <em>every id must be
        unique</em>. Any header of types <code>h2</code>, <code>h3</code> and <code>h4</code> without <em>id</em>s will
    that get scanned by the table of contents will be given a number as an <em>id</em> so its links can scroll to it.
</p>
<p>
    You can completely ignore and give no <em>id</em>s to your headers, everything will still work as normal. I just put
    <em>id</em>s in all of them so all of my URLs look prettier and human-readable. Otherwise, the URLs will have
    numbers in them instead of whatever I wrote for the <em>id</em>. You click around these links and experiment, don't
    be afraid to mess around.
</p>
<h2 id="about-html">About HTML</h2>
<p>
    Lastly, you might have noticed that articles are written in HTML. If you don't know what that is, that's fine. Some
    of you might recognize some of this syntax from using old forums, and that's exactly what it is. Everything is
    written inside these <code>&lt;tag-name&gt;contents&lt;/tag-name&gt;</code> tags, and tags can contain tags as well.
    The <code>p</code> tag stands for paragraph while the <code>h</code> tags stands for headers, the lower the number
    the more important the header, so <code>h1</code> header is the biggest header while the <code>h6</code> header is
    the lowest.
</p>
<p>
    Most of your articles will be just paragraphs and header tags, with the ocasional <code>img</code> tag for images
    (more on images <a toarticle="images-example">here</a>) and other tags for tables and notes (see <a
        toarticle="tables-example">here</a> for tables and <a toarticle="notes-example">here</a> for notes), as well as
    <code>ul</code> or <code>ol</code> for lists (more about lists <a
        href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_lists.asp" target="_blank">here</a>).
</p>
<p>
    In case none of these are what you're looking for, I'd recommend looking into <a
