# Fantasy World Wiki

I wanted to make a wiki for my TTRPG world so my players could have all the information they wanted in a cool way to navigate and learn.

I realized making the basis for it could be entirely separated from my world itself, so I made it in a way anyone can fork it and make their own worlds, even non programmers.

If you want to use it, feel free! Read [HOW_TO_MAKE_YOUR_OWN.md](HOW_TO_MAKE_YOUR_OWN.md) to learn how to do it. Once you're done with this file and have a working page, read the articles on the [demo](https://eldskald.github.io/fantasy-world-wiki) to learn more details on how to write your own stuff.

If you're a developer, read [HACKING.md](HACKING.md) to get started, but I recommend reading [HOW_TO_MAKE_YOUR_OWN.md](HOW_TO_MAKE_YOUR_OWN.md) and the deploy articles as well to understand the features in practice.
